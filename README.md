# 👋 Hi, I'm Daniel Madeley

I'm a full-stack engineer with a background in structural and computational engineering.  
I love building systems that are technically robust, beautifully designed, and genuinely useful.

## 🧠 Tech I Love Working With

- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, TypeScript, Framer Motion  
- **Backend:** Go, Python, FastAPI, gRPC  
- **Data & Infra:** PostgreSQL, ElectricSQL, Docker, AWS  
- **Other:** PWA, Offline-first design, Event-driven architectures

## 🛠 Favourite Project

**Form + Function** – a suite of structural engineering tools built to optimise engineers’ workflows.  
It includes:
- A project manager based on the **RIBA stage system**
- Automated structural calculations and a **LaTeX-based report editor**
- A microservice backend in **Go** (gRPC), with **Python** for computation and **TypeScript** for the UI  

This project pushed me to become a polyglot developer and merge engineering with software design.
