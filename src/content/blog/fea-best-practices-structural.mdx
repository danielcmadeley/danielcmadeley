# FEA Best Practices for Structural Engineers

Finite Element Analysis is a powerful tool, but it's also a tool that can produce convincing-looking wrong answers. After years of using FEA on projects ranging from residential buildings to F1 facilities, here are the practices that help me get reliable results.

## The Cardinal Rule

**Never trust a result you can't verify by other means.**

Before diving into mesh refinement and solver settings, remember: FEA is a tool to refine your understanding, not replace engineering judgment. Always have a back-of-envelope check ready.

## Model Setup Fundamentals

### Choosing the Right Element Type

For building structures, common choices:

| Application | Element Type | Notes |
|------------|--------------|-------|
| Beams/columns | Line elements | Include shear deformation for deep members |
| Slabs | Shell elements | Minimum 4 elements between supports |
| Walls | Shell or plate | Consider out-of-plane behavior |
| Foundations | Solid elements | Or springs for simplified models |
| Connections | Spring elements | When stiffness matters |

### Mesh Quality Matters

Poor mesh quality is the most common source of FEA errors. Guidelines:

**Aspect ratio**: Keep elements roughly square (ratio < 3:1)

**Mesh refinement**: Finer mesh near:
- Load application points
- Support locations
- Geometric discontinuities
- Areas of high stress gradient

**Convergence check**: Run the analysis with progressively finer meshes until results stabilize (within 5% typically acceptable).

```
Mesh study example:
Mesh 1: 500mm elements  → Peak stress: 245 MPa
Mesh 2: 250mm elements  → Peak stress: 267 MPa
Mesh 3: 125mm elements  → Peak stress: 278 MPa
Mesh 4: 62.5mm elements → Peak stress: 281 MPa

Mesh 3 to 4 change: 1.1% - convergence achieved
```

### Boundary Conditions

The most critical and error-prone aspect of FEA modeling:

**Supports**
- Pinned support: Restrains translation, allows rotation
- Fixed support: Restrains all degrees of freedom
- Roller: Restrains perpendicular translation only

**Reality check**: Does your boundary condition represent actual behavior?
- "Fixed" columns on pad foundations aren't truly fixed
- "Pinned" beam connections have some rotational stiffness
- Soil-structure interaction affects foundation behavior

### Loading

**Load application**:
- Point loads: Create stress concentrations - use bearing plates
- Distributed loads: More realistic but check tributary areas
- Pattern loading: Required for slabs per EC2

**Load combinations**:
- Generate all relevant combinations before analysis
- Use envelope results for design
- Check that critical combination makes physical sense

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Stress Singularities

FEA will predict infinite stress at:
- Point loads on shells
- Re-entrant corners
- Support points

These aren't real - they're mathematical artifacts. Solutions:
- Apply loads over finite area
- Use fillet radii at corners
- Interpret results away from singularity
- Use stress averaging

### 2. Hourglassing

In reduced integration elements, hourglass modes can develop:
- Zero-energy deformation patterns
- Results look plausible but are wrong

Prevention:
- Use full integration elements
- Enable hourglass control
- Check for suspicious deformation patterns

### 3. Shear Locking

Thin elements with low-order shape functions can be overly stiff:
- Beam elements that don't bend properly
- Shell elements that behave like rigid plates

Solutions:
- Use elements with shear deformation
- Increase polynomial order
- Use specialized thin element formulations

### 4. Overconfidence in Linear Analysis

Linear analysis assumes:
- Small displacements
- Linear material behavior
- No contact or gaps

When to go nonlinear:
- Displacements > L/50
- Stresses approaching yield
- Stability concerns (P-delta, buckling)
- Connection behavior with gaps

## Validation Strategies

### Back-of-Envelope Checks

Before any FEA, estimate:

**Beam deflection**: δ = 5wL⁴/384EI (simply supported, UDL)

**Natural frequency**: f = (π/2L²)√(EI/m) (simply supported)

**Axial stress**: σ = P/A

If FEA differs by more than 20% from hand calc, investigate why.

### Reaction Checks

Sum of reactions must equal applied loads:
- ΣFx = Applied Fx
- ΣFy = Applied Fy
- ΣFz = Applied Fz

Most software reports equilibrium - always check this.

### Deflected Shape Review

Does the deformation make sense?
- Symmetric loading should give symmetric deformation
- Supports should have zero displacement (in restrained direction)
- No unexpected movement

### Benchmark Problems

Validate your modeling approach on problems with known solutions:
- Simply supported beam under UDL
- Plate with central point load
- Cantilever with end load

## Project-Specific Examples

### Flat Slab Analysis (Kidbrooke Village)

For RC flat slabs with complex column layouts:

1. Model full floor plate, not isolated bays
2. Use shell elements with appropriate thickness
3. Apply pattern loading as per EC2
4. Extract design moments using Wood-Armer method
5. Verify against equivalent frame method

### Portal Frame Analysis (F1 Facilities)

Large-span portal frames with crane loading:

1. Model frame as 2D plane stress or 3D line elements
2. Include realistic connection stiffness
3. Apply crane loads at multiple positions
4. Run P-delta analysis for stability
5. Check deflections against functional requirements

### Transfer Structure (High-Rise)

Heavy transfer beams supporting multiple floors:

1. 3D model with solid elements for transfer
2. Full dead load from above before superimposed
3. Construction sequence analysis
4. Check bearing stresses at supports
5. Long-term deflection considerations

## Software-Specific Tips

### Tekla Structural Designer
- Good for code checking of standard structures
- Limited mesh control - verify critical areas in dedicated FEA

### SCIA Engineer
- Excellent mesh control and result visualization
- Watch for default settings on European codes

### Robot Structural Analysis
- Powerful but steep learning curve
- Custom result combinations require setup

### ETABS
- Optimized for buildings
- P-delta analysis well-implemented

## Conclusion

FEA is indispensable for modern structural engineering, but it requires disciplined application:

1. **Plan your analysis** before starting the software
2. **Simplify intelligently** - complexity doesn't equal accuracy
3. **Validate relentlessly** - hand calcs, reactions, deformed shape
4. **Document assumptions** - for review and future reference
5. **Question results** - if they seem wrong, they probably are

The best analysts I know spend more time thinking than clicking. Invest in understanding your structure before investing in mesh refinement.
