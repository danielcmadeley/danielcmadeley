# Revit for Structural Engineers: Tips and Best Practices

Revit has become the de facto standard for structural BIM modeling in the UK. After using it on projects ranging from single dwellings to high-rise towers, here are the tips I wish I'd known from the start.

## Model Setup

### Start with the Right Template

A good structural template includes:
- Standard structural families
- View templates for plans, sections, schedules
- Pre-configured line styles and patterns
- Sheet templates with title blocks
- Standard annotation families

Don't model from scratch - inherit from proven templates.

### Levels and Grids First

These are the skeleton of your model:

**Levels:**
- Create all structural levels before modeling
- Name consistently (Level 00, Level 01, not Ground, First)
- Include non-structural levels (Top of Parapet, Roof)
- Set accurate elevations from survey data

**Grids:**
- Establish grid system with architect
- Use logical naming (A-Z horizontally, 1-n vertically)
- Consider grid extents on different levels
- Lock important grids

### Worksets Strategy

For larger projects, organize with worksets:

```
Worksets example:
- Shared Levels and Grids
- Structural Foundations
- Structural Frame - Substructure
- Structural Frame - Superstructure
- Structural Slabs
- Analysis (if modeling)
- Coordination (reference links)
```

**Key principle**: Open only worksets you need. It improves performance.

## Modeling Techniques

### Foundation Modeling

**Pad foundations:**
- Use Structural Foundations family
- Model at correct level (underside of pad)
- Include pedestal if needed

**Pile foundations:**
- Custom families often needed
- Consider how piles appear in schedules
- Link pile layout from geotechnical engineer if available

**Ground beams:**
- Use Structural Framing
- Set correct reference level
- Check beam family has appropriate parameters

### Concrete Frame

**Columns:**
- Host to correct level
- Use base offset for accuracy
- Define Top Level for multi-story columns
- Check attachment to beams/slabs

**Beams:**
- Reference Level vs Reference Point (understand the difference)
- Use beam systems for regular layouts
- Check beam-column connections

**Slabs:**
- Structural floors, not architectural
- Define layers properly (structural vs finishes)
- Slab edge families for drop edges
- Consider openings early (easier to add now)

### Steel Frame

**Standard sections:**
- Load UK sections (UKB, UKC, PFC, angles)
- Set correct cross-section rotation
- Check Start/End connection settings

**Connections:**
- Model for visualization, not detail
- Use generic connection families
- Don't over-detail - coordination purpose

**Bracings:**
- Use structural framing
- Check member is "Brace" type
- Model to working points (node to node)

## Productivity Techniques

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Learn these, use them constantly:

```
VV / VG - Visibility Graphics
WT - Tile Views
WC - Close Hidden Views
ZA - Zoom All
HH - Hide Element
HR - Reset Hidden
DI - Aligned Dimension
EL - Spot Elevation
PP - Pin Element
UP - Unpin
```

Customize additional shortcuts in Options > Keyboard.

### View Templates

Create and use view templates:
- Structural Plan - Foundations
- Structural Plan - Frame
- Structural Section - Working
- Structural Section - Presentation

Apply templates, then override only what's necessary.

### Filters for Structural Visualization

Create filters based on structural parameters:
- By material (Concrete, Steel)
- By size (highlight large sections)
- By phase (existing vs new)
- By design status (checked vs unchecked)

### Schedules

Power features for structural engineers:

**Calculated fields:**
```
Volume (m³) = Length * Width * Height
Weight (kN) = Volume * Density
```

**Conditional formatting:**
- Highlight oversized members
- Flag missing parameters
- Identify design issues

**Export to Excel:**
- For quantities takeoff
- For design input
- For checking purposes

## Coordination Workflows

### Linking Architectural Models

1. **Copy/Monitor** for grids and levels
   - Alerts when architect changes
   - Don't copy elements you'll model differently

2. **View filters** to control link visibility
   - Create "Linked Architecture" filter
   - Set to halftone or transparent

3. **Coordination review** workflow
   - Regular model exchange schedule
   - Clash detection in Navisworks
   - Issues tracked in shared system

### IFC Export

When sending to analysis software:
- Use built-in IFC export
- Check settings (IFC 2x3 or IFC4 as required)
- Test export/import cycle
- Document any geometry translation issues

### Working with Contractors

**Model delivery:**
- Native RVT preferred (for Navisworks federation)
- IFC for interoperability
- DWG for legacy workflows

**Shop drawing interface:**
- Define what contractor can modify
- Consider live link for complex projects
- Establish deviation tolerance

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Wrong Reference Levels

Beams modeled at wrong level cause:
- Incorrect schedules
- Wrong quantities
- Analysis model errors

Check reference levels when strange things happen.

### 2. Unhosted Elements

Elements not properly hosted:
- Won't move with grids
- Break when levels change
- Cause coordination issues

Host everything appropriately.

### 3. Over-Detailed Modeling

Not everything needs full detail:
- Bolts in connection families - rarely needed
- Rebar in concrete - separate discipline usually
- Weld symbols - annotation, not geometry

Model what adds value. Over-modeling slows everything.

### 4. Ignoring Warnings

Revit warnings indicate problems:
- Duplicate elements in same location
- Slight off-axis geometry
- Hosting issues

Address warnings regularly - they accumulate into serious problems.

### 5. Poor File Management

**Avoid:**
- Working on central file directly
- Not syncing regularly
- Editing others' worksets without checking

**Practice:**
- Local files for all work
- Regular sync with central
- Compact file periodically
- Audit and purge before issue

## Integration with Analysis

### Analytical Model

Revit's analytical model:
- Automatically generated from physical
- Often needs adjustment (supports, releases)
- Export to Robot, ETABS, or via open formats

**Tips:**
- Check analytical model in 3D view
- Verify node locations
- Set supports correctly
- Confirm member releases

### Robot Structural Analysis Link

Direct integration:
- Sends geometry and loads
- Returns results to Revit
- Can update sections automatically

**Caveats:**
- Not all Revit elements transfer perfectly
- Complex geometry may need manual adjustment
- Always verify results independently

## Conclusion

Revit is powerful but requires discipline. The best Revit users:
- Start with solid foundations (templates, standards)
- Use keyboard shortcuts and view templates
- Understand hosting and reference levels
- Coordinate actively with other disciplines
- Model purposefully (not everything, just what's needed)

Invest in learning Revit properly - it's a career-long tool. The time spent upfront pays dividends on every project thereafter.
