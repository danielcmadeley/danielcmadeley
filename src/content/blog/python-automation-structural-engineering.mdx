# Automating Structural Engineering Workflows with Python

As structural engineers, we spend a significant portion of our time on repetitive tasks: extracting data from models, running similar calculations for different load cases, generating reports, and coordinating with other disciplines. Python has become my secret weapon for reclaiming that time.

## Why Python for Structural Engineering?

Python's appeal lies in its simplicity and the ecosystem of libraries available for engineering applications:

- **NumPy and SciPy** for numerical calculations
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis
- **openpyxl** for Excel automation
- **python-docx** for report generation
- **pyRevit** for Revit automation

## Real-World Example: Beam Schedule Automation

Here's a practical example that saved me hours on a recent project. I needed to extract beam data from a Revit model and generate a formatted schedule for the contractor:

```python
import pandas as pd
from openpyxl import Workbook
from openpyxl.styles import Font, Alignment, Border, Side

def process_beam_schedule(revit_export_path, output_path):
    # Read the Revit export
    df = pd.read_csv(revit_export_path)

    # Clean and process data
    df['Section'] = df['Type Name'].str.extract(r'(\d+x\d+)')
    df['Length_m'] = df['Length'].astype(float) / 1000

    # Group by floor level
    grouped = df.groupby('Level')

    # Create formatted Excel output
    wb = Workbook()
    ws = wb.active
    ws.title = "Beam Schedule"

    # Add headers with formatting
    headers = ['Mark', 'Section', 'Length (m)', 'Steel Grade', 'Finish']
    for col, header in enumerate(headers, 1):
        cell = ws.cell(row=1, column=col, value=header)
        cell.font = Font(bold=True)
        cell.alignment = Alignment(horizontal='center')

    # Populate data
    row = 2
    for level, beams in grouped:
        ws.cell(row=row, column=1, value=f"Level: {level}")
        ws.merge_cells(start_row=row, start_column=1, end_row=row, end_column=5)
        row += 1

        for _, beam in beams.iterrows():
            ws.cell(row=row, column=1, value=beam['Mark'])
            ws.cell(row=row, column=2, value=beam['Section'])
            ws.cell(row=row, column=3, value=round(beam['Length_m'], 2))
            ws.cell(row=row, column=4, value='S355')
            ws.cell(row=row, column=5, value='Intumescent paint')
            row += 1

    wb.save(output_path)
    print(f"Schedule generated: {output_path}")
```

## Automating Load Combinations

Another common task is generating load combinations according to Eurocodes. Instead of manually creating these in your analysis software, automate it:

```python
def generate_eurocode_combinations(dead_load, imposed_load, wind_load):
    """
    Generate ULS combinations per EC0 Eq. 6.10a/b
    """
    gamma_g = 1.35  # Permanent actions
    gamma_q = 1.5   # Variable actions
    psi_0_imposed = 0.7
    psi_0_wind = 0.5

    combinations = {
        'ULS_6.10a_Imposed': {
            'G': gamma_g * dead_load,
            'Q': gamma_q * psi_0_imposed * imposed_load,
            'W': gamma_q * psi_0_wind * wind_load
        },
        'ULS_6.10a_Wind': {
            'G': gamma_g * dead_load,
            'Q': gamma_q * psi_0_imposed * imposed_load,
            'W': gamma_q * wind_load
        },
        'ULS_6.10b_Imposed': {
            'G': 0.925 * gamma_g * dead_load,
            'Q': gamma_q * imposed_load,
            'W': gamma_q * psi_0_wind * wind_load
        }
    }

    return combinations
```

## Integration with BIM Workflows

The real power comes when you integrate Python with your BIM workflow. I use pyRevit to create custom tools that run directly within Revit:

```python
# pyRevit script example
from pyrevit import revit, DB

doc = revit.doc

# Collect all structural framing
collector = DB.FilteredElementCollector(doc)
framing = collector.OfCategory(DB.BuiltInCategory.OST_StructuralFraming)
framing = framing.WhereElementIsNotElementType().ToElements()

# Calculate total steel tonnage
total_weight = 0
for element in framing:
    param = element.LookupParameter("Weight")
    if param and param.HasValue:
        total_weight += param.AsDouble()

# Convert to tonnes
total_tonnes = total_weight * 0.453592 / 1000
print(f"Total steel tonnage: {total_tonnes:.2f} tonnes")
```

## Getting Started

If you're new to Python, here's my recommended learning path:

1. **Start with the basics**: Variables, loops, functions
2. **Learn Pandas**: Essential for data manipulation
3. **Pick one automation target**: Start with Excel automation
4. **Build incrementally**: Automate one task at a time

## The ROI of Automation

On my F1 facility projects, Python automation has saved approximately 20% of my time on documentation and data processing. That's time I can redirect to actual engineering problems.

The initial investment in learning pays off quickly. Once you've built a script for beam schedules, adapting it for column schedules or foundation schedules takes minutes, not hours.

## Conclusion

Python isn't replacing engineering judgment - it's amplifying our capabilities. The engineers who embrace automation will be able to take on larger, more complex projects while maintaining quality and meeting deadlines.

Start small, automate one tedious task, and build from there. Your future self will thank you.
