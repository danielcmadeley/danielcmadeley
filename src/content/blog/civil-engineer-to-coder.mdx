# From Civil Engineer to Coder: My Self-Taught Journey

When I graduated with my Civil Engineering degree from Leeds Beckett, I knew how to analyze structures, design beams, and read drawings. What I didn't know was how to write a line of code. Four years later, I'm automating workflows, building web applications, and applying computational thinking to engineering problems daily.

Here's how I got here, and what I've learned along the way.

## The Spark

My first engineering job involved a lot of repetitive tasks: extracting data from CAD drawings, reformatting spreadsheets, creating similar calculations with slightly different inputs. I remember thinking, "There has to be a better way."

A colleague mentioned he'd automated some reports using Python. I had no idea what Python was, but I was intrigued.

## Starting with Python

### Month 1: The Basics

I started with free resources:
- **Python.org tutorial**: Official docs, surprisingly accessible
- **Automate the Boring Stuff**: Free online book, practical focus
- **YouTube tutorials**: Visual learners will appreciate these

The breakthrough came when I automated my first real task: renaming 200 files according to a naming convention. What would have taken an hour took 10 minutes to script (and 30 seconds to run).

### Months 2-3: Engineering Applications

I focused on tools relevant to my work:
- **Pandas**: For manipulating exported data from Revit
- **NumPy**: For numerical calculations
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting results

My first substantial project: a script that read steel beam data from an Excel export, calculated utilization ratios, and highlighted any overstressed members.

### Months 4-6: Building Confidence

I started applying Python to real projects:
- Automated load combination generation
- Created reinforcement schedules from model data
- Built a simple beam calculator for quick checks

The compound effect kicked in - each script saved time, and each project taught new skills.

## Adding TypeScript and Web Development

After a year of Python, I wanted to build tools with better interfaces than command-line scripts. This led me to web development.

### Why TypeScript Over JavaScript?

Coming from engineering, I appreciated TypeScript's type system. It's like dimensionally checking your equations - catches errors before runtime.

### Learning Web Technologies

My path:
1. **HTML/CSS basics**: Building static pages
2. **JavaScript fundamentals**: Making pages interactive
3. **TypeScript**: Adding type safety
4. **React**: Component-based UI development
5. **Next.js/Astro**: Full-stack frameworks

This website you're reading is built with Astro and TypeScript - a project that taught me as much as any course.

## What I've Learned About Learning

### 1. Project-Based Learning Works Best

Courses and tutorials are good for syntax, but real learning happens when you're solving real problems. Pick a task you do regularly and automate it.

### 2. Embrace the Struggle

There were (and still are) days when nothing works and error messages make no sense. This is normal. The debugging process is where deep understanding develops.

### 3. Read Other People's Code

GitHub is full of well-written code. When I learned Python, I read source code of libraries I used. It's like reading good writing to become a better writer.

### 4. Don't Try to Learn Everything

The programming ecosystem is vast. Focus on tools relevant to your work. For structural engineers, that might mean:
- Python for automation
- SQL for data management
- Grasshopper for parametric design

You don't need to master React unless you're building web apps.

### 5. Teach What You Learn

Writing this blog, explaining concepts to colleagues, creating documentation - all reinforce learning. If you can explain something simply, you understand it.

## Practical Impact on My Engineering Career

### Time Savings

Conservative estimate: Python automation saves me 5-10 hours per month on routine tasks. Over a year, that's significant.

### Better Analysis

Computational tools let me explore more options. Instead of analyzing three load cases manually, I can analyze thirty programmatically and find the critical ones.

### Career Opportunities

The intersection of engineering and coding is underserved. Being able to bridge both worlds opens opportunities:
- Computational design roles
- BIM development positions
- Engineering software companies
- Tech-forward consultancies

### Problem-Solving Mindset

Perhaps the biggest benefit: programming has changed how I think about problems. Breaking complex issues into smaller functions, considering edge cases, testing assumptions - these skills transfer beyond code.

## Advice for Engineers Starting Out

### Start Today, Start Small

You don't need a course or bootcamp. Open Python, print "Hello World", and go from there. The barrier to entry has never been lower.

### Solve Your Own Problems

The best motivation is automating tasks you find tedious. What do you do repeatedly that a computer could do?

### Join Communities

- **Stack Overflow**: For specific questions
- **Reddit**: r/learnpython, r/structural engineering
- **LinkedIn**: Connect with computational designers
- **GitHub**: Share your work, contribute to others'

### Be Patient

Learning to code is like learning a new language. It takes time, and there are plateaus. Six months of consistent practice beats six days of intensive study.

### Keep Engineering First

Code is a tool, not a replacement for engineering judgment. The goal is to be a better engineer who can code, not to become a programmer who used to do engineering.

## What's Next

I'm currently exploring:
- **Machine learning** for structural optimization
- **Building custom tools** with APIs for analysis software
- **Contributing** to open-source engineering projects

The journey continues. Every new skill unlocks possibilities I hadn't imagined.

## Conclusion

Learning to code as a structural engineer has been one of the best investments of my career. It's not easy, and it's never "done" - there's always more to learn.

But the ability to automate tedious tasks, build custom tools, and think computationally has made me a more effective engineer. If you're considering starting, don't wait. The best time to learn was five years ago. The second-best time is today.
