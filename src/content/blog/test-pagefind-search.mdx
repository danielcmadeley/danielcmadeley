# Test Blog Post for Search Functionality

This is a simple test blog post to verify that pagefind search is working correctly. It contains no MathJax content, only plain text and basic markdown formatting.

## Purpose

The purpose of this post is to test whether the search functionality works with simple content. We want to verify that pagefind can index and search through this content properly.

## Test Keywords

Here are some specific keywords that should be searchable:

- **stiffness** - this word should be found in search
- **matrix** - another test word
- **engineering** - a common term
- **search** - the functionality we're testing
- **pagefind** - the search tool we're using

## Content Structure

This post has:

1. Headers of different levels
2. Paragraphs with various keywords
3. Lists (like this one)
4. Bold and italic text
5. No mathematical equations or complex formatting

## Search Test Cases

When searching for this post, these terms should work:

- "test" - should find this post
- "pagefind" - should find this post
- "stiffness" - should find this post
- "matrix" - should find this post
- "search functionality" - should find this post

## Conclusion

If this post shows up in search results but the stiffness matrix analysis post doesn't, then we know the issue is likely related to MathJax content interfering with pagefind's indexing process.

This test will help us isolate whether the problem is with MathJax specifically or with the pagefind configuration in general.
