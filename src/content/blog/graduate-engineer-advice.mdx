# Advice for Graduate Structural Engineers: What I Wish I Knew

Starting your career as a graduate structural engineer is exciting and overwhelming in equal measure. After four years progressing from graduate to chartered-track engineer, here's what I wish someone had told me on day one.

## The First Six Months

### Embrace Not Knowing

You're not expected to know everything. In fact, you're not expected to know much at all. What matters is:
- Willingness to learn
- Asking good questions
- Taking notes and not asking the same question twice
- Being proactive about seeking work

The worst graduates I've seen are those who pretend to understand when they don't. The best ask clarifying questions and learn quickly.

### Learn Your Software

Get comfortable with the tools:

**Essential:**
- AutoCAD: Reading and marking up drawings
- Excel: Everything runs on spreadsheets
- Your firm's analysis software (Tekla, SCIA, Robot)

**Useful:**
- Revit: Even basic navigation helps
- Bluebeam: PDF markup and review
- BIM coordination software (Navisworks, Solibri)

**Valuable:**
- Python: For automation (future-proofs your career)
- Grasshopper: For computational design roles

### Understand the Business

Engineering firms make money by selling engineers' time. Understanding this changes your perspective:
- Time recording matters (do it accurately)
- Fees are limited (design efficiently)
- Repeat clients drive growth (quality matters)
- Your productivity affects project profitability

## Technical Development

### Master the Basics First

Before touching complex analysis software, ensure you can:

1. **Sketch load paths** through any structure
2. **Hand calculate** simple beam moments and deflections
3. **Size members** approximately before detailed design
4. **Read drawings** - GA, section, reinforcement details

These fundamentals never become obsolete.

### Learn from Existing Designs

Every project has precedent. When starting a new task:
1. Find similar previous projects
2. Study what was done and why
3. Understand what worked and what didn't
4. Adapt rather than reinvent

### Build a Personal Library

Collect useful resources:
- Calculation templates you've verified
- Standard details that work
- Reference documents for quick lookup
- Notes from training courses

Future-you will thank present-you.

### Verify Everything

Never trust software output blindly:
- Check reactions sum to applied loads
- Verify deflections against simple hand calcs
- Question results that seem too good (or too bad)
- Understand what the software is doing

## Project Experience

### Volunteer for Variety

Early in your career, breadth matters more than depth:
- Different building types
- Different materials (steel, concrete, timber)
- Different project stages (concept to construction)
- Different roles (design, checking, site visits)

Specialization can come later.

### Site Visits Are Gold

Every chance to visit site:
- See how structures are actually built
- Understand why details matter
- Learn what causes problems
- Build relationships with contractors

One site visit teaches more than ten drawings.

### Construction Stage Experience

If you can work on projects during construction:
- Technical queries force you to really understand the design
- RFIs reveal what wasn't clear in drawings
- Seeing your designs built is incredibly satisfying
- Problems teach more than successes

## Professional Development

### Work Toward Chartership

ICE or IStructE membership matters:
- Professional recognition
- Technical competence validation
- Networking opportunities
- Career progression requirement at most firms

Start your training agreement early. Log experience diligently.

### CPD Is Your Responsibility

Don't wait for your company to train you:
- Attend webinars (many are free)
- Read technical papers
- Join professional institution groups
- Learn from colleagues

Set a personal goal: learn something new every week.

### Build Your Network

Relationships matter throughout your career:
- Be helpful to colleagues
- Stay connected with university peers
- Attend industry events
- Engage professionally on LinkedIn

The engineering community is smaller than you think.

## Soft Skills

### Communication Matters More Than You Think

Technical ability is necessary but not sufficient:

**Writing:**
- Reports that clients can understand
- Emails that get actioned
- Specifications that are unambiguous

**Speaking:**
- Presenting designs clearly
- Explaining technical issues to non-engineers
- Defending decisions in design reviews

Practice these actively.

### Learn to Estimate

Clients always want to know "how long?" and "how much?"

Build your estimation skills:
- Track how long tasks actually take
- Compare estimates to actuals
- Learn what drives duration (complexity, information, approvals)

Accurate estimates build trust.

### Take Ownership

The difference between good and great engineers:
- **Good**: Completes assigned tasks competently
- **Great**: Takes ownership of outcomes, anticipates problems, suggests improvements

Own your work. Don't just do what you're told - think about what needs to be done.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Designing in Isolation

Structural engineering doesn't exist in a vacuum:
- Coordinate with architecture (clearances, aesthetics)
- Coordinate with MEP (penetrations, loadings)
- Consider construction (sequence, access, materials)

The best technical solution isn't always the best overall solution.

### 2. Over-Complicating Designs

Simple designs are:
- Easier to build
- Cheaper to construct
- Less prone to errors
- Easier to check

Complexity should be justified, not default.

### 3. Ignoring Feedback

When your work is checked:
- Don't take corrections personally
- Understand why changes were needed
- Learn from the feedback
- Apply lessons to future work

Checking exists to catch errors and develop engineers.

### 4. Not Asking for Help

Senior engineers expect questions. What frustrates them:
- Not being asked until there's a problem
- The same question repeated
- Questions that show no attempt to solve first

Ask early, ask smart, and document answers.

## Long-Term Thinking

### Career Paths Vary

Not everyone follows the same trajectory:
- Technical specialist
- Project manager
- Team leader
- Business development
- Academia/research
- Entrepreneurship

Explore options. Talk to people in different roles.

### Stay Curious

The best engineers I know:
- Read widely beyond their specialty
- Try new tools and methods
- Question "we've always done it this way"
- Never stop learning

Curiosity compounds over a career.

### Take Care of Yourself

Engineering can be demanding:
- Deadlines are real
- Responsibility can weigh heavily
- Office culture varies

Set boundaries. Maintain interests outside work. Physical and mental health enable sustained performance.

## Conclusion

A career in structural engineering is rewarding. You'll see your designs built, solve challenging problems, and contribute to the built environment.

The graduates who thrive:
- Work hard at the basics
- Seek variety in experience
- Communicate effectively
- Take ownership of their development

Start well, stay curious, and the career will take care of itself.
