# Portal Frame Design in SCIA Engineer: The Complete Engineering Guide

Designing portal frames in SCIA Engineer requires careful attention to geometry, restraints, and analysis methods. This comprehensive guide walks through the complete design process, from initial modeling to final code checks, with emphasis on correct restraint modeling and real-world considerations.

---

## 🏗️ Overview of Portal Frame Design

Portal frames are widely used for **industrial buildings**, warehouses, and sports facilities due to their efficiency in spanning large distances with minimal intermediate supports. The key to successful portal frame design lies in understanding the structural behavior and correctly modeling all constraints.

### Key Design Principles
- **Rigid connections** at the knee joint transfer moments between column and rafter
- **Pinned bases** are typically used for economy and constructability
- **Lateral restraint systems** prevent out-of-plane buckling
- **Second-order effects** must be considered for slender frames

### SCIA Engineer Advantages
SCIA Engineer provides integrated tools for portal frame design including automated geometry generation, comprehensive load application, advanced stability analysis, and code-compliant design checks.

## 📋 Step 1: Project Setup and Initial Configuration

### Creating a New Portal Frame Project
Start SCIA Engineer and create a new project. Navigate to **File > New Project** and select the appropriate template. For portal frames, choose either "Steel Structure" or use the "Blank Project" option for maximum flexibility.

### Project Configuration
Set up your project parameters including:
```
Design standard:     Eurocode (EN 1990-1998)
Steel grade:         S355 (or S275 for economy)
Units:              Metric (kN, m, MPa)
National Annex:     Select appropriate country
Analysis type:      3D with 2nd order effects
```

### Material Definition
Define your steel material properties. For S355 steel, SCIA typically includes:
- Yield strength: 355 N/mm²
- Ultimate strength: 510 N/mm²
- Young's modulus: 210,000 N/mm²
- Poisson's ratio: 0.3

## ⚖️ Step 2: Portal Frame Geometry Modeling

### Example Building: Industrial Warehouse
Let's design a typical single-bay portal frame with these parameters:
```
Span:               30.0 m
Column height:      8.0 m
Roof pitch:         5° (1:11.4)
Bay spacing:        6.0 m
Frame spacing:      6.0 m
Eaves height:       8.0 m to underside of haunch
```

### Using Catalogue Blocks
SCIA Engineer provides pre-defined portal frame templates through **Structure > Catalogue Blocks > Portal Frames**. Select the appropriate configuration:

1. **Access Catalogue Blocks**: Structure menu > Catalogue Blocks
2. **Select Portal Frame Type**: Choose symmetric pitched portal
3. **Input Dimensions**: Span, height, pitch angle
4. **Define Cross-Sections**: Initial estimates for columns and rafters

### Manual Geometry Creation
Alternatively, create geometry manually using **Structure > Nodes and Beams**:

**Key Points (Nodes):**
- Base nodes: (0, 0, 0) and (30, 0, 0)
- Eaves nodes: (0, 8, 0) and (30, 8, 0)
- Apex node: (15, 9.31, 0) [accounting for 5° pitch]

**Beam Elements:**
- Left column: Node 1 to Node 3
- Right column: Node 2 to Node 4
- Left rafter: Node 3 to Node 5
- Right rafter: Node 4 to Node 5

---

## 📐 Step 3: Cross-Section Assignment

### Initial Section Selection
For a 30m span portal frame, typical starting sections might be:

**Columns:**
- HEA 300 or HEB 300 for standard heights
- Consider larger sections (HEA 400) for tall columns

**Rafters:**
- IPE 550 or IPE 600 for 30m spans
- May require plate girders for longer spans
- Haunch details at knee connections

### Haunch Modeling
Haunches are critical for portal frame efficiency. In SCIA Engineer:

1. **Create Haunch Profile**: Cross-section > Variable Cross-section
2. **Define Geometry**: Linear variation from knee to point of contraflexure
3. **Typical Haunch Length**: 10-15% of span (3-4m for 30m span)
4. **Depth Variation**: Start depth = rafter depth + haunch depth

Example haunch definition:
```
Start section:      IPE 600 + 400mm plate (total depth 1000mm)
End section:        IPE 600 (600mm depth)
Haunch length:      3.5m from knee joint
Variation:          Linear taper
```

## 🔍 Step 4: Critical Restraint Modeling

### Understanding Restraint Requirements
Portal frames are susceptible to **lateral-torsional buckling** and **in-plane instability**. Correct restraint modeling is essential for:
- Preventing out-of-plane buckling of rafters
- Stabilizing columns against weak-axis buckling
- Providing overall frame stability

### Roof Restraint Systems

**Purlin Restraints:**
Purlins provide lateral restraint to rafter compression flanges. Model as:
1. **Point Restraints**: At each purlin location (typically 1.5-2.0m spacing)
2. **Restraint Type**: Lateral restraint (Y-direction) and twist restraint
3. **Spring Stiffness**: Use CD = 60 N/mm/mm for typical purlin/sheeting systems

**Implementation in SCIA:**
- **Location**: Structure > Restraints > Point Restraints
- **Apply to**: Top flange of rafters at purlin points
- **Direction**: Perpendicular to frame plane (Y-direction)
- **Type**: Spring restraint with appropriate stiffness

### Side Cladding Restraints

**Column Restraints:**
Side cladding restrains column compression flanges:
1. **Spacing**: Typically at rail locations (1.5-2.0m centers)
2. **Stiffness**: CD = 80 N/mm/mm for typical rail/cladding systems
3. **Critical Locations**: Always restrain at points of maximum compression

### Foundation Restraints

**Base Connections:**
Most portal frames use pinned bases for economy:
```
Translational restraints:  All directions (Ux, Uy, Uz = 0)
Rotational restraints:     About weak axis only (Rx = 0)
Free rotations:           About strong axis (Ry, Rz = Free)
```

**Fixed Base Alternative:**
For very tall or lightly loaded frames:
```
All translations fixed:    Ux, Uy, Uz = 0
All rotations fixed:      Rx, Ry, Rz = 0
```

## 💪 Step 5: Load Application and Combinations

### Permanent Loads (Dead Load)

**Self-Weight:**
SCIA automatically calculates frame self-weight. Additional permanent loads include:
- Purlins and rails: 0.15 kN/m² on roof
- Cladding: 0.25 kN/m² on walls and roof
- Services allowance: 0.15 kN/m²

**Application Method:**
1. **Create Load Case**: Loads > Load Cases > Add "Dead Load"
2. **Apply Area Loads**: Convert to line loads on rafters
3. **Typical Values**: 0.5-0.8 kN/m on rafters, 0.4 kN/m on columns

### Variable Loads

**Imposed Roof Load:**
According to EN 1991-1-1:
- Access category H (roof): 0.4 kN/m²
- Maintenance loads: Consider 1.0 kN concentrated load

**Snow Load:**
Calculate according to EN 1991-1-3:
- Ground snow load: Varies by location (0.4-1.5 kN/m²)
- Shape coefficient: μ₁ = 0.8 for pitched roofs
- Thermal coefficient: Ct = 1.0 (unheated buildings)

Example calculation for UK (sk = 0.6 kN/m²):
```
Snow load = μ₁ × Ct × Ce × sk
Snow load = 0.8 × 1.0 × 1.0 × 0.6 = 0.48 kN/m²
```

### Wind Load Analysis

**Pressure Coefficients:**
EN 1991-1-4 provides external pressure coefficients:
- Windward wall: Cpe = +0.8
- Leeward wall: Cpe = -0.5
- Windward roof: Cpe = -0.9 to -0.5
- Leeward roof: Cpe = -0.5

**Dynamic Response:**
Check if dynamic analysis required:
- Building height > 15m, or
- Natural period > 1.0 second

**SCIA Wind Load Wizard:**
1. **Access**: Loads > Wind Load Generator
2. **Building Geometry**: Input dimensions and roof angle
3. **Wind Parameters**: Basic wind velocity, terrain category
4. **Generate Loads**: Automatic application to frame surfaces

## 📏 Step 6: Load Combinations and Analysis

### Ultimate Limit State Combinations
EN 1990 fundamental combination:
```
1.35 × Dead + 1.5 × Live + 1.5 × Snow
1.35 × Dead + 1.5 × Live + 1.5 × Wind
1.35 × Dead + 1.5 × Wind + 1.05 × Snow
```

### Serviceability Combinations
For deflection checks:
```
1.0 × Dead + 1.0 × Live + 0.5 × Snow
1.0 × Dead + 0.6 × Wind
```

### Analysis Settings
Configure analysis parameters:
- **Analysis Type**: 2nd order (P-Delta effects)
- **Iteration Control**: Newton-Raphson method
- **Convergence Criteria**: Force 0.01%, displacement 0.01%
- **Imperfections**: Include frame imperfections per EN 1993-1-1

### Frame Imperfections
EN 1993-1-1 requires consideration of:
- **Bow imperfection**: L/300 for frame out-of-plumb
- **Sway imperfection**: φ = 1/200 (basic value)
- **Application**: Apply as equivalent horizontal forces

## 🔧 Step 7: Stability Analysis and Design Checks

### Linear Buckling Analysis
Perform eigenvalue analysis to determine:
- **Critical load factors**: Should exceed 10 for frame stability
- **Buckling modes**: In-plane, out-of-plane, and local buckling
- **Effective lengths**: For member design

**SCIA Implementation:**
1. **Run Analysis**: Calculation > Linear Stability
2. **Review Results**: Check first mode load factor
3. **Mode Shapes**: Visualize critical buckling patterns

### Member Design Checks

**Steel Code Checks:**
SCIA performs comprehensive EN 1993-1-1 checks:
- **Cross-section resistance**: Moment, shear, axial
- **Member buckling**: In-plane and out-of-plane
- **Lateral-torsional buckling**: With proper restraint modeling
- **Interaction**: Combined bending and compression

**Critical Design Locations:**
- **Knee joints**: High moments and axial forces
- **Rafter mid-span**: Maximum sagging moments
- **Column bases**: High compression with moments

### Connection Design
Portal frame connections require special attention:

**Knee Joint (Moment Connection):**
- High moment transfer capability
- Often requires stiffeners and haunches
- Check bolt shear, bearing, and tension
- Verify plate buckling and beam web resistance

**Base Connection (Pinned):**
- Design for vertical reaction only
- Include nominal moment resistance (10% of plastic moment)
- Check anchor bolt shear and concrete bearing

---

## 📐 Step 8: Serviceability Checks

### Deflection Limits
Portal frames typically have generous deflection limits:

**Vertical Deflection:**
- **Roof deflection**: L/200 = 30,000/200 = 150mm
- **Column sway**: H/150 = 8,000/150 = 53mm

**Calculation in SCIA:**
1. **Apply SLS loads**: Use characteristic combinations
2. **Run Analysis**: Linear analysis sufficient for serviceability
3. **Check Results**: Compare with code limits

### Dynamic Considerations
For large spans, check natural frequency:
- **Target frequency**: > 3 Hz to avoid resonance
- **SCIA Modal Analysis**: Calculation > Dynamics > Natural Frequencies

---

## 🏗️ Step 9: Advanced Modeling Techniques

### Non-Linear Analysis
For accurate frame behavior:
- **Material non-linearity**: Steel yielding and strain hardening
- **Geometric non-linearity**: Large displacement effects
- **Connection behavior**: Semi-rigid joint modeling

### Tapered Members
For optimized designs:
1. **Create Variable Section**: Cross-section > Variable Cross-section
2. **Define Variation**: Linear or parabolic depth variation
3. **Optimization**: Minimize material while meeting strength requirements

### Multiple Bay Frames
For continuous structures:
- **Frame Spacing**: Typically 6-8m for economic design
- **Bracing Systems**: Plan and elevation bracing
- **Construction Sequence**: Consider erection stability

---

## 🛠️ Step 10: Practical Design Considerations

### Constructability Issues

**Transportation Limits:**
- **Maximum depth**: 1.8m for road transport
- **Maximum length**: 18m standard, longer requires permits
- **Splices**: Required for longer rafters

**Erection Sequence:**
- **Temporary bracing**: Required during construction
- **Crane capacity**: Affects maximum piece sizes
- **Weather sensitivity**: Steel erection limitations

### Connection Details

**Knee Joint Options:**
- **Welded haunch**: Most efficient but requires shop welding
- **Bolted splice**: Field-friendly but requires larger sections
- **Curved knee**: Architectural preference but complex fabrication

**Base Detail Considerations:**
- **Anchor bolt layout**: Standard patterns for economy
- **Grout requirements**: Level bases and load distribution
- **Drainage**: Prevent water accumulation around bases
